  <h1>“Official” Footsquare Rules</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The ball must not be hit with the hand, palm, wrist, forearm, elbow or top of the shoulder. Incidental contact that is unavoidable is acceptable within the judges’ discretion
    </li>
    <li>
      The ball can bounce two times before being hit into another players square
    </li>
    <li>
      If the ball bounces in one person’s square on the first bounce and bounces in another player’s square on the second bounce, the second player must hit the ball into another square or they are out
    </li>
    <li>
      The ball is playable off the following surfaces: cars, buildings, tree branches, snow and curbs
    </li>
    <li>
      The ball must have sufficient downward momentum to bounce at least twice. A ball that is rolled directly horizontal as to the receiving player cannot return the ball will result in the kicking player being out
    </li>
    <li>
      Kicks that land on the body of an opposing player are legal and playable. Body shots should be played as if the ball bounced off a wall- playable within two bounces
    </li>
    <li>
      Only the line judges who are paying attention can make the final calls. Those who are paying attention have the final call in disputes
    </li>
    <li>
      A do-over is an acceptable resolution to fiery disagreements and must be called in the event that a consensus can not be quickly reached by line judges
    </li>
    <li>
      No hitting the ball with bottom of foot in a ‘spiking’ motion
    </li>
    <li>
      If ball lands in the bed of a truck after the first or second bounce, the kicker is out.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the ball bounces underneath a car and the ball is returned to play with a downward angle to where a player cannot return it, the kicker will be ruled out
    </li>
    <li>
      A player may catch the ball between their legs/knees/feet to eliminate the kicking player
    </li>
    <li>
      The ball may only one time or not at all before being caught
    </li>
    <li>
      The ball must be secured enough for the catching player to take 3 steps without the ball touching the ground
    </li>
    <li>
      A player may only step once in any other player’s square before returning both feet to their own square.
    </li>
    <li>
      Having both feet in an opponent's square is an automatic out
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Standard Game Flow</h1>
  <p>One person stands in each of the four squares, any extra players become line judges.
  All play will begin with the server putting the ball into play by tossing it to any of the other three squares
  This initial toss may not be ‘aggressive’. It’s purpose is simply to begin play.
  If a player (the kicker) gets another player (the receiver) out, the kicker will take receiver’s place if the receiver was in a square of a higher number.</p>

  <h1>Elimination</h1>
  <p>When the time allotted for footsquare runs out, normal play ceases and elimination begins. From this point on, all “outs” are permanent. If you are called out, you become a line judge until the end of the FINAL SHOWDOWN.</p>

  <h1>FINAL SHOWDOWN</h1>
  <p>The FINAL SHOWDOWN occurs when there are only 2 people left in elimination. In addition to standard game rules, these additional rules apply:
  The players take turns serving. Serves can be aggressive but must bounce twice in the receiver’s square and not touch any other surface (line judge, car, etc). The receiver may choose to hit the ball after one bounce if they wish.
  A winner is decided when a player wins two points in a row, once as server and once as receiver.</p>
